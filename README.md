# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to aid a customer find hotel information based on weather preferences and then create maps that contain markers within specific cities requested. The Weather_Database folder contains the code used to generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. The Vacation_Search folder contains a customer travel destinations map that is created based on input from a customer on weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. This map will be displayed with Google Maps API and has markers that gives Hotel Name, City, Country, and current weather there. Lastly, Vacation_Itinerary folder contains code and images of the travel itinerary map that is created with Google Directions API. It shows the route between four cities chosen from a customer’s possible travel destination. The map contains pop-up markesr for each city in the itinerary as well with route to get to all four cities.
