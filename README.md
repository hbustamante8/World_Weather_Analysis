# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project 

The purpose of this project is to aid a customer to find hotel information based on weather preferences and then create maps that contain markers within specific cities requested. Tools primarily used in this project are Python, API requests, and Panda’s library. The Weather_Database folder contains the code used to generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. The Vacation_Search folder contains a customer travel destinations map that is created based on input from a customer on weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. This map is displayed with Google Maps API and has markers that gives Hotel Name, City, Country, and current weather there. Lastly, Vacation_Itinerary folder contains code and images of the travel itinerary map that is created with Google Directions API. It shows the route between the four cities chosen from a customer’s possible travel destination. The map contains pop-up markers for each city in the itinerary as well as the route to get to all four cities.
